What type of object is returned by the GetFiles() method of the DirectoryInfo class?,FileInfo[] (an array of FileInfo objects)
Why is the StreamWriter object passed as a parameter to methods like addTopHTML and buildHTMLBody?,To allow multiple methods to write to the same output file stream.
What is the benefit of using the static keyword for helper methods like buildHTMLBody in a console application's Main class?,It allows the methods to be called directly from the static Main method.
Which C# loop is used to traverse the array of text files returned by the GetFiles() method?,foreach

"In the tutorial, what is used to populate the headings of the jQuery UI accordion items?",The name of each text file (without the extension).
Why does the tutorial consolidate multiple text files into a single HTML file?,To demonstrate reading from multiple sources and writing to a single output.
What is the significance of the Close() method in file handling?,It releases the file lock so other processes or methods can access the file.
How is the final HTML output displayed to the user in the tutorial?,The application launches the user's default web browser to open the file.
What does an HTML file essentially consist of according to the tutorial's description?,A text file containing markup that is interpreted by a web browser.
What happens if you instantiate a StreamReader outside of a using block and do not call Close()?,The file may remain locked and memory may not be released immediately.
"In the buildHTMLBody method, what is the third parameter used for?",Passing the string content read from a text file.
Why is it necessary to extract the filename without the extension when creating HTML headings?,"To provide a clean, readable title for the user interface."
What is the purpose of the search pattern parameter in the DirectoryInfo.GetFiles method?,To filter the returned files based on specific naming or extension criteria.
"In the tutorial, what is the default name given to the console application?",wildcats application
What is the role of the initializedSourceDirectory method in the provided code?,To ensure the source directory exists and contains at least a default information file.
Which C# keyword allows for the inclusion of external namespaces like System.IO at the top of a file?,using
What is the outcome of passing a directory path to the DirectoryInfo constructor?,It initializes a new instance of the DirectoryInfo class for that specific path.
How does the application determine the content of each accordion item?,By reading the text from individual .txt files in the source directory.
What is the specific subject matter used for the text files in the tutorial's example?,Wildcats
"In the provided code, where is the catch block located in relation to the file handling logic?",It follows the try block to handle any exceptions thrown during execution.
"What does the asterisk (*) signify in a search pattern like ""*.txt""?",It acts as a wildcard representing any sequence of characters.
Which method is used to launch the default browser in C#?,Process.Start()
How does the tutorial describe the relationship between HTML and jQuery?,jQuery is a JavaScript library used to add interactivity to the markup in an HTML file.
What is the final step in the initializedSourceDirectory method?,To return the DirectoryInfo object representing the source directory.
Which variable name is used in the code to store the consolidated text before writing to the HTML file?,content
What is the benefit of downloading the code from GitHub as suggested in the tutorial?,It saves time and avoids manual transcription errors from the video.
What is the purpose of the addBottomHTML method in the Wildcat application?,To write the closing HTML tags to finish the document structure.
"In the tutorial's loop, what happens to the content variable during each iteration?",It is overwritten with the text from the next file in the directory.
What determines the path of the source directory relative to the executable?,The rootPath variable derived from the base directory.
Why does the tutorial suggest pausing the video or using GitHub for the HTML/jQuery code?,Because explaining HTML and jQuery is beyond the scope of the C# tutorial.
What type of error is prevented by checking if a directory exists before creating it?,An IOException or error from attempting to create an already existing folder.
"In the tutorial's logic, what does a single accordion item represent?",The content of one individual text file.

What is the primary advantage of using a Console application for this tutorial?,It provides a simple environment to focus on file handling logic without complex UI code.
